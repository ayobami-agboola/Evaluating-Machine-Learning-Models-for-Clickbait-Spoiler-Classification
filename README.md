# Evaluating-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Clickbait-Spoiler-Classification

This study evaluates five machine learning models, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Na√Øve Bayes for classifying clickbait spoilers into phrase, passage, and multi types. Using BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec vectorization with stemming and lemmatization.The Webis Clickbait Spoiling Corpus 2022 dataset made available for SemEval 2023 clickbait challenge was used for this study. The dataset is made up of 14 fields of information about the clickbaits, with 5000 social media posts and corresponding spoilers that reveal the actual content of the clickbait. The spoilers are categorized into three types on the basis of their length and structure, about 42% short phrase spoilers, 40% long passage spoilers, and 17% multiple non-consecutive pieces of text. The dataset came in three separate sets of json lines format, 3200 training, 800 validation and 1000 testing sets.
